### Workhive
A secure job listing platform where authenticated users can create, update, and delete job posts. Each job is linked to its creator, ensuring that only the owner can edit or delete their postings.

### Features :

1. User Authentication: Only authenticated users can access the features of the website. To create, update, or delete job postings, users must sign in to their accounts.
2. Create Job Postings: Employers can easily create job posts, providing essential details such as job title, description, qualifications, and location. This ensures that candidates get all the information they need to apply.
3. Edit Job Postings: If youâ€™re an employer who created a job post, you can edit the details of your listing at any time. Keep your job posts up-to-date with any changes to the role or qualifications.
4. Delete Job Postings: Employers have the ability to remove any job postings they have created. If a position is filled or no longer available, simply delete the listing to keep the platform organized and relevant.
5. User Permissions: Each job post is linked to the user who created it. Only the creator of the job post can make modifications (edit or delete) to that particular post, ensuring proper control over the listings.
